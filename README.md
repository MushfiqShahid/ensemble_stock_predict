Enhanced Multi-GPU/CPU Ensemble Stock Prediction System

This system uses both GPU and also CPU. This reduces the training time and pressure on the hardware. 
This system predicts the stock price of Alphabet Inc. The dataset is taken from the NASDAQ website. 

The key components of the project is :
1. 3 Neural Network Models: LSTM+Attention, Transformer, CNN-LSTM
2. 2 Traditional ML Models: Random Forest, XGBoost
3. 1 Meta-Learning Model: Neural ensemble combiner
4. Advanced Feature Engineering with 40+ technical indicators
5. Uncertainty Quantification
